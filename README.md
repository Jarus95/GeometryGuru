# GeometryGuru v2.0
This is an improved version **[v1.0](https://github.com/Jarus95/GeometryGuru/tree/releases/v1.0)**

This program finds the area of a geometric figure

Have a look at `Program.cs` file and you can see how I have used:

* Console input/output
* Arithmetic operations to find the area of triangle
* Logical operations for constructing a triangle
* Loop operations
